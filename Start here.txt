First start connecting all the components as shown in the connections.png diagram.
Then try running the IrRecorder.cpp file in your arduino and press the buttons in your remote you want to turn on the led
Next open the serial monitor and copy both button's id numbers, it should be more like this one: 1FE50AF
Then, open the Main Code.cpp file and paste them in lines 11-12 right after "0x" that is important because it tells the code that is a hexadecimal number.
The cool thing about this code is that you can modify the led pin and replace it with a motor or almost everything, if you want to conect anything that uses more than 5V try using a 5Vrelay.
You can also try changing the code itself to do more things than just turning on and off something
When you finish, try uploading the code in your arduino.
If anything goes wrong and you don't know what to do, feel free to contact me via discord.
